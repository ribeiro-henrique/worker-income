# Delivery Management System

This is a small C# console project for managing information about workers and contracts in a delivery service. It allows you to input data about departments, workers, and their contracts, and then calculate the total income of a worker for a specific month and year.

## Features

1. **Department and Worker Registration:** You can register departments and workers associated with those departments. Data includes department name, worker name, level (Junior, Mid-Level, or Senior), and base salary.

2. **Contract Registration:** For each worker, you can add contracts that include information such as date, hourly rate, and duration in hours.

3. **Total Income Calculation:** You can calculate the total income of a worker for a specific month and year. The program will sum the worker's base salary with the total value of contracts within the provided month and year.

## How to Use

1. Run the program and follow the instructions in the console.

2. Start by registering the department name and worker's data.

3. Next, input information about the worker's contracts. You can add as many contracts as needed.

4. After registering the contracts, you can calculate the worker's total income for a specific month and year.

5. The program will display the worker's name, department name, and total income for the specified month and year.

## Technologies Used

This project was developed in C# and utilizes the following technologies:

- C# Programming Language
- Enumerations (Enums) to represent worker levels
- Classes and objects to represent workers, departments, and contracts
- Input and output of data through the console
